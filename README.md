What It Is
---
This is an NextJS application that allows users to play blackjack with certain rules.
The rules are listed within the FAQ of the black jack table


What I Used
---
* NextJS  
* Vercel
* Chakra
* jest
* [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/)

Challenges and Solutions
---

* Challenge #1: Learning Blackjack and the rules:
  * This was my first time playing blackjack and learning the rules and implementing them. It was a fun non technical challenge
* Challenge #2: Limiting scope
  * There are many features you want to add in given an open-ended request. In order to create a MVP I reduce styling and animcations. All these can be added later as add ons. The goal was the game rules and functionality existed for the MVP
* Challenge #3: Testing
  * I was only to do a small amount of end to end testing using cypress. It would be great to expand testing to mock API calls and more component testing

  
Wish to include
--
* Saving a history of the games
  * Allow users to see a history of their wins and lost
* Add a global state management library like redux to reduce use of context provider
* Have a user account so a history of the games can be saved to them
* More error handling
